# Problem Statement 
The predication of the Age of a Crab based its physical features like Weight, Shell Weight, Length,etc.

## Dataset

Chosen Dataset : Crab Age Predication Dataset (https://www.kaggle.com/sidhus/crab-age-prediction)

Task : Use Regression to estimate the Crab Age.

Target Variable : Age

Minimum Age = 1

Maximum Age = 29

Average Age = 9.95479065


## Model(s) Used

**Regression** : It is a statistical method used to establish a relationship between a dependent variable and another variable(s) generally referred to as Indepedent Variables.Here, the relationship is defined in terms of correlation co-efficient. Finally a regression line is computed which is of the form y = mx + c where m is the slope and c is the y-intercept.

**Multiple Linear Regression** : It is a regression approach where there is one dependent variable and there are multiple indepedent variables. For this scenario, the dependent variable is the Age of the Crab and independent variables are few other features from the dataset.

## Future Work
Trying to use a combination of multiple modelling/boosting techniques to improve accuracy.
